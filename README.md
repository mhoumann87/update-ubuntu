# Script to update and clean a Debian/Ubuntu system
Update is a command line tool made to make it easy for me to update my
Ubuntu based Linux system.

Based on Joe Collins script [Up](https://github.com/EzeeLinux/up-debian_ubuntu_update_tool)

Version 1.5 adds the options to shutdown or reboot after update. Update now includes update of snap packages.
